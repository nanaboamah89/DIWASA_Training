# DIWASA_Training
Digital Innovations for Water Secure Africa (DIWASA) is an International Water Management Institute (IWMI) project with initial funding for 2020-2023 but a second phase extending till 2027. In the first phase, the project focused on two main components - Water Accounting (at selected basins and continental levels) and Water Resilience (information products for support managing flood and drought risks). This led to the development of multiple water data products and tools. The second phase of DIWASA aims to improve water security across scales (basin, country, and continental level) in Africa through improved availability, access, and application of water data, products, and tools. It will focus on working with stakeholders and Digital Earth Africa to enhance the use of water data, products, and tools to have a greater impact on water security in Africa.

Objectives
The project aims to enhance water security across scales in Africa through improved water data availability, accessibility, and institutional capacity and to leverage on innovative digital techniques for sustainable water resources management. It is structured as four pillars with user engagement and capacity development (Pillar 2) taking the bulk of the project budget. Within Pillar 1, the data products and tools developed under Phase I will be further enhanced and, more importantly, user application cases (use cases) developed together with end users.
